# ESP32 - TCP/IP socket server example

Here follows an example of TCP/IP socket server for ESP32-S3 microcontroller.

Main features:

* This example uses static IP
* It works by echoing back to TCP/IP socket client whatever it sends to this TCP/IP socket server (ESP32-S3)
* Suggestion: for TCP/IP socket client side, use Hercules terminal (for more details, check: https://www.hw-group.com/software/hercules-setup-utility )
* This project has been developed using ESP-IDF v4.4. If you use another ESP-IDF version, some APIs may differ.
